```{r}
choco <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lbchu/ds202_labs/master/choco.csv")
head(choco)
```

```{r}

library("ggplot2")

```

```{r}
ggplot(choco, aes(Rating)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) 

```
Ratings are unimodal, with most falling between 2.5-3.5, with very few outliers on the very low end and fewer on the upper end.

```{r}
ggplot(choco, aes(Cocoa.Pct, Rating)) + geom_point()

```

It appears that ratings do not depend on cocoa percentage.

"Company.Location" contains location. It is stored as a factor, a vectory array that stores as an int in hexadecimal.
