##Question Set

##1. Chocolate ratings are distributed normally. With an outlier at a rating of 5.
```{r}
hist(choco$Rating, main ="Chocolate Rating")
```

##2. It seems ratings are not dependent on cacao percentage in a chocolate bar
```{r}
plot(choco$Rating, choco$Cocoa.Pct)
```

##3."Company.Location" is classified as a "factor". This is different than a "character" type as factors are assigned to a numeric level, where characters just compose a string.
```{r}
class(choco$Company.Location)
```
